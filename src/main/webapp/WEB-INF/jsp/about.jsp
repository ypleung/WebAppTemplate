         <h1>About</h1>
         <p>Rome was not built in a day and neither is software. 
         Having been a programmer for over 10 years. Through my experience, I have realized the importance of reviewing the work of countless individuals before me before tackling any software problem.</p>
         <p>Everyday the industry is changing and I am playing catch-up to the countless new libraries and design concepts that are being created.</p>
         <p>No matter how intelligent or brilliant you are the hive mind of the web will outweigh what any individual knows.</p>
         <p>This is my contribution to the hive a comprehensive web package run on a MVC platform using JSON and Hibernate for modelling, Bootstrap and JSP pages for a sexy view and Spring REST for the controller.</p>
         <p>This is no just a website that runs on the coding framework it documents.</p>
         <p>I hope you take away some knowledge and skills as I have from my many years on the Internet.</p>
         <p>Please spread because ideas deserve to be free.</p>
         <br/>
